# AmusementPark
 Amusement Park Simulation for AP CS S1 Final
 GROUP MEMBERS: Margot Benrimo, Jonathan Ibarra, Tyler Gerace

# PROMPT: 
Students will design the software for an amusement park using Object Oriented Programming. The members of each team of three determine the Attraction class, a parent class for an amusement park attraction. It includes such data members as maximum number of riders, cost of tickets, number of tickets to use, number of attendants, cost of utilities, length of ride, riders per hour, hours per day, speed, height, etc. 

Students create a client program and test methods for calculations such as daily cost,profit, etc. Each student then creates a specific attraction of their own that inherits the agreed-upon data members of the parent class. Each student makes a class that has an is-a relationship to the Attraction class. So the first student might create a FerrisWheel class , the second a Merry_Go_Round class, and the third 
a RollerCoaster class. Each inherits the basic Attraction class, plus has its own 
unique data members and methods. Interesting data members might include speed, 
number of turns and other factors, depending upon the attraction. Methods unique to 
the child class include calculating g-force, "puke factors," and daily profit. Students have a lot of fun making their classes more outrageous than the next, all the while using inheritance and concepts such as is-a and has-a.
